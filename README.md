# CS-230

  The client was looking to expand on the game Draw It or Lose It. This is a game with teams and each team guesses what it being drawn. The application needed to render different sized images quickly as well as update the input controller depending on the device being used. Being an online mulitplayer application, this requires proper storage of data and efficient memory managment. These factors create a smooth experience for the user. To protect these users and their information, system security must be top of the line and up to date. With the use of authentication, encryption, and strong passwords, the system should keep eveyones data safe. My first choice was for Windows, but that was just a saftey net for me. As I moved forward, LInux looked better and better. Then as the final installment of the template project approached, I saw my instructors announcment about Linux and I went with that OS for the remainder of the project. Approaching software design was overwhelming at first, but as I progressed, the puzzle pieces came together. Seeing the corrilation of languages needed across all platforms started to make sense. The client`s needs are of utmost importance and once those needs are recorded, making a skeleton of the application becomes easier.
